# Webserver For Driving an EV3 while projecting the data collected by an Ultrasonic sensor in AR (powered by Vuforia Studio)

## Designed by Dan McGinn in Summer 2019 at the Tufts CEEO

Move the files **ARDemo.html**, **ARDemoWebserver.py**, & **appkey.txt** to a directory on an ev3 running <a href="https://www.ev3dev.org/">ev3dev</a>

The EV3 will serve a webpage that can be used to contol the movement of the ev3 and to display data collected by the ev3 sensors
